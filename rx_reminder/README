A sample SMArt REST App that gets a medication list and displays when
each prescription fulfillment will run out.

locally on port 8000.  You'll need the following python packages:
web.py, rdflib, rdflibextras, and pyparsing.

To get started on ubuntu, you can
  apt-get install git-core python-webpy python-pyparsing python-setuptools
  easy_install -U "rdflib>=3.0.0" rdfextras

  * Install python 2.7: http://www.python.org/getit/
  * Install git: http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/
  * Install setuptools:  http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py (download + run)
  * c:\pythonxx\Scripts\easy_install.exe web.py pyparsing rdflib rdfextras

Now. obtain and launch reminder.py:
  git clone https://github.com/smart-platforms/smart_rx_reminder.git
  cd smart_rx_reminder
  python reminder.py 8000

patient, and doing some very simple processing.
